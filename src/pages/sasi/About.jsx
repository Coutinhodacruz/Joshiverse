              We are always delighted to support these schools with variety of materials to enhance the learning 
              experience of the learners, expand their educational horizon, and boost their fighting chance for a 
              bright future and afford them a competitive advantage in these technological times.

              We run our outreaches on a yearly basis, with this being our third edition - we have had the privilege 
              of contributing to the Makoko community, the Pacelli School for the Blind, and the Wesley School for the 
              Hearing Impaired. We want them to know that we and many others are rooting for them; we believe in them; 
              and we will keep cheering them on as they progress towards greater heights beyond societal limitations.‚ù§Ô∏èüíØ
